<h1> The best movies according to Daniel</h1>

<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>My favorite fantasy film (series). I really like the immersion in the world.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>My favorite sci-fi film (the first one only). I really like the concept behind the movie.</p>
<h3>A Quiet Place</h3>
<p>My favorite recent movie (series). There aren't a lot of good horror movies lately that also have a good plot behind them.</p>
